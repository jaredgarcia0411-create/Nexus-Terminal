# Nexus Terminal — HANDOFF.md

## Active Handoff Only

Historical completed sections (Scanner Realtime Data Pipeline, Tech Debt PRs 1-5, SSE Phases 0-2, Keyboard Shortcuts, Discord Research Report Extraction Phases 1-4, SSE Jarvis Streaming, Discord Research Schwab Validation, Research Tab Full Redesign, Direct Relay WebSocket, Macro Summary Upgrade) were removed to keep this file focused.
Use git history and the `specs/` directory for archived implementation detail.

### Session Maintenance Checklist

- [x] Refreshed `AGENTS.md` with current build/lint/test commands, single-test workflows, and coding conventions for agentic coding tools.
- [x] Verified command set and conventions against the current repository configuration (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vitest.config.ts`, `eslint.config.mjs`).
- [x] Updated Charts tab drawing UX: left-aligned toolbar, double-click selection, per-drawing delete, and persisted Fibonacci levels.
- [ ] Update `AGENTS.md` after Discord import feature ships — document new tables, API routes, parser module, env vars

## Schwab Relay Auth — Parallel Blocker

> Generated: 2026-03-16 | Status: OPEN

- Relay logs show repeated `Failed to load Schwab user preference (401)`.
- This keeps `realtime_quotes` stale or empty, which directly degrades Scanner results.
- Schwab refresh tokens expire every **7 days** — you need to re-login via the Schwab OAuth flow weekly.

### Next steps

1. Re-link Schwab account in the app (Markets tab → Schwab status)
2. After relinking, check Fly logs for `LOGIN successful, subscribing...` and quote-write activity
3. If 401 persists after fresh relink, investigate whether the relay is loading the correct tokens from the DB
