# Nexus Terminal - HANDOFF.md

> Updated: 2026-06-01
> Purpose: active execution context for Codex. Older implementation detail lives in git history, `specs/`, and durable docs such as `docs/repo-cleanup.md`.

Historical completed sections (Sprints 1-15, Tier 1 Cleanup, Chart Drawings, Multi-Day Charts, CSV/Cover-Close flows, Workflow Maintenance) were removed to keep this file focused. Use git history and `docs/repo-cleanup.md` for archived implementation detail.

## Recent Completed Context

- **Sprint 14 - Daily Review Tag Centralization:** trade tags are now the shared Watchlist/Daily Trades tagging model; added tag rename/merge management.
- **Sprint 15 - Cleanup Test Coverage + Backtesting Lazy Loading:** added focused tests and lazy-loaded `BacktestingTab` at the Charts-tab boundary.
- **Repo cleanup (`docs/repo-cleanup.md`):** completed; repo is in good standing as of 2026-06-01.
- **Sprint 16 - Legacy DB Column Drop:** closed as won't-do (commit `9da2d49`). Legacy `trades.pnl` / `trades.executions` stay in place.

## Recently Completed

### Sheets - Sprint 1: Data Layer

Status: completed 2026-06-01 (commit `176e525`).

Outcome:
- 3-table model shipped (`sheets`, `sheet_rows`, `sheet_members`) with migration `0045`, columns folded into a `columns` jsonb + `columnsVersion` guard.
- Access-checked routes from day one via `getSheetRole`: list/create, get/patch/delete (owner-only edits), duplicate, row append + optimistic-version patch/delete.
- Validation in `lib/validations/sheets.ts` (hard bounds) + 12 vitest cases.

Validation:
- `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` (736 passed) all green.
- Migration generated + applied (`npm run db:migrate`).

### Sheets - Sprint 2: Management UI + Editable Grid

Status: completed 2026-06-01 (commit `da1bba0`).

Outcome:
- First Sheets UI: `Sheets` subtab under Management — list rail, create/rename/duplicate/delete, `react-data-grid` editable grid with text/select/checkbox editors, optimistic save with 409 conflict toasts.
- `hooks/use-sheets.ts` owns all data + mutations; pure grid helpers in `lib/sheets/grid.ts` (unit-tested).
- Grid themed via `.sheets-grid` mapping `--rdg-*` vars onto app semantic tokens (follows light/dark).

Validation:
- `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` (740 passed) all green.
- Authenticated browser smoke not run (no `agent-browser` in Codex sandbox); deferred surfaces (`report`/`chart`/`action` cells, tag options, sharing) are not built yet, not broken.

Known cosmetic debt (rolled into Sprint 3): `SheetFormDialog` date input + `AddColumnDialog` type select dropped the `[color-scheme:dark]` class the rest of the app uses.

### Sheets - Sprint 3: Sharing / Members

Status: completed 2026-06-01 (commit `93c3646`).

Outcome:
- Owner-only member routes: add-by-email (`POST .../members`), editor/viewer role change + remove (`PATCH`/`DELETE .../members/[userId]`), with the owner's membership immutable (never assigned/changed/removed via these routes).
- `use-sheets` gained `addMember`/`updateMemberRole`/`removeMember` (local `members` updates, surfaces server error text); new owner-only `ShareSheetDialog` wired into `SheetsTab`.
- Cleared Sprint-2 `[color-scheme:dark]` debt on `SheetFormDialog` date input + `AddColumnDialog` type select; added `sheets-members` validation tests.

Validation:
- `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` (744 passed) all green.
- Manual authenticated sharing smoke not run (no `agent-browser` in Codex sandbox) — still pending.

### Roadmap (deferred — Sheets)
- **Manual authenticated smoke for sharing** (still pending: invite logged-in coworker, flip role, remove; unknown-email error; viewer read-only / editor sees no manage buttons).
- Self-leave (non-owner removing own membership), ownership transfer, email/invite-link notifications for users who haven't signed in.
- Research "Add to Sheets" import + interactive `report`/`chart`/`action` cells.
- Templates / per-day "start today's sheet" flow beyond plain Duplicate.
- CSV export, archive/unarchive UI, undo/redo, polling/SSE invalidation, drag-reorder rows/columns.
- `AGENTS.md` update once import lands (document the full Sheets surface at once).

## Implementation Style

Write the simplest correct code that satisfies the active spec. Specifically:

- Match the existing conventions in the file you're editing. Do not introduce new patterns, helpers, abstractions, or file layouts unless the spec explicitly calls for them.
- No future-proofing. No feature flags, no "in case we need it later" parameters, no extracted helpers that have a single caller. If a value is only used once, inline it.
- No defensive code at internal boundaries. Trust your own code and framework guarantees; validate only at system boundaries: user input, external APIs, and DB reads of untrusted JSON.
- No comments unless the why is non-obvious (a hidden constraint, a workaround, a surprising invariant). Don't restate what the code says.
- If a step in this spec looks more complex than it needs to be, flag it and propose the simpler version before implementing — don't silently "improve" the spec, but don't write code that's more elaborate than the problem requires either.
- If you spot an existing simpler pattern in the codebase that fits, use it instead of writing new code.

This is a personal trading platform built solo. Readability > cleverness; debuggable > elegant; small diff > sweeping refactor. Three similar lines beats a premature abstraction.

## Session Maintenance

- Keep this file compact: active specs only while work is in flight, short summaries after validation.
- If a new multi-step feature starts, replace or append a self-contained execution spec with exact file paths, ordered changes, acceptance criteria, and validation requirements.
- If only docs/workflow assets change, run `npm run workflow:audit`.
- Do not modify `.env*` or secret files.
