# Nexus Terminal - HANDOFF.md

> Updated: 2026-05-28
> Purpose: active execution context for Codex. Older implementation detail lives in git history, `specs/`, and durable docs such as `docs/repo-cleanup.md`.

Historical completed sections (Sprints 1-5, Tier 1 Cleanup, Chart Drawings, Workflow Maintenance, AskEdgar News Filter Expansion) were removed to keep this file focused. Use git history for archived implementation detail.

## Next Up: Sprint 6 — Rate Limiting

> Status: NOT YET SPECCED

Scope: DB-backed sliding-window rate limiter for expensive endpoints (`/api/research-report`, `/api/askedgar/tldr`). New `rate_limit_hits` table, shared `lib/rate-limit.ts` helper, integration into target routes, 429 responses with standard headers. See `docs/repo-cleanup.md` § "Rate Limiting On Expensive Endpoints" for the finding.

## Recently Completed

### CSV Parser: Position-Aware B Resolution

Status: completed 2026-05-28 (commit 5ea235b).

Outcome:
- Lifted DAS Trader's chronological position-resolver into shared `resolveSidesByPositionState` helper in `lib/parsers/utils.ts`.
- `defaultParser` now runs the resolver in `buildContext`, disambiguating raw `B` to `MARGIN` (long open) when no open short exists, or `B` (cover) when one does.
- Deleted `builtinNormalizeRow`; both `processCsvData` and `extractRawExecutions` default to `defaultParser`. Removed `parser.id === 'default'` bypass in `lib/trade-utils.ts`.

Validation:
- `npm run lint` passed.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passed.
- `npm test` passed (92 files, 671 tests).
- Manual browser smoke with coworker's 2026-05-28 CSV: PENDING — confirm ASTC/ATPC LONG trades appear, NCT/SPRC SHORT remain correct, ARM shows as open long.

### Cover/Close Entry Flow — Manual Entry (FIFO) + Import Side Resolution

Status: completed 2026-05-28 (commit c846e4a).

Outcome:
- Part A: manual New Trade form now detects an offsetting open position (same symbol, opposite direction) and prompts to close it FIFO instead of creating a new opposite open trade. New `lib/cover-position.ts` (pure FIFO math) + `app/api/trades/cover/route.ts` handle full close / partial / flip; `useTrades.handleCoverPosition` merges affected rows by id.
- Part B: import (raw CSV) path seeds `resolveSidesByPositionState` with the client's currently-open positions so a later-day `B` covering a carried-over short labels as a cover, not a new long. Threaded through `extractRawExecutions` → `collectRawExecutions` → `processImportFiles`.
- Known limits (intentional): multi-day folder import in one action won't link an open+cover across batches; same-symbol intraday round-trip while holding a carried-over position can mislabel. Supported workflow documented for coworkers.

Validation:
- `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` (93 files, 677 tests) all passed.
- Manual browser smoke (Part A confirm/partial/flip/decline, Part B import seeding): PENDING user verification.

## Session Maintenance

- Keep this file compact: active specs only while work is in flight, short summaries after validation.
- If a new multi-step feature starts, replace or append a self-contained execution spec with exact file paths, ordered changes, acceptance criteria, and validation requirements.
- If only docs/workflow assets change, run `npm run workflow:audit`.
- Do not modify `.env*` or secret files.
